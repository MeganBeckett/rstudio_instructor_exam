## Why?

- Your data is already in a database.
- You have too much for your computer's memory to handle at once.
- Retrieve only what you need.
- All of your code is in R! :)

## Connect to a database
### Many different databases

## Connect to a database

### Create the connection

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(dbplyr)

con <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), path = ":dbname:")

```

--
A more realistic connection:

```{r eval = FALSE}
con <- DBI::dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), 
                      dbname = "my_database"
                      host = "database.lsdkjfslfj.uk-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
                      user = "student",
                      password = "my_password")
```

---
## Check your understanding

What is the most likely output from running the following piece of code and why?

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(dplyr)

con <- DBI:dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "data_raw/mammals.sqlite")

data <- tbl(con, "species") 

nrow(data)
```

1. `NA` - as the `species` table is empty and therefore the `data` dataframe is empty.
2. `NA` - as `dplyr is lazy and only pulls the data into R when explicitly asked.
3. `54` - as we have created a `data` dataframe in R from the `species` table in the database, which has 54 rows.

## Query a database

### Using the `dplyr` syntax

Behind the scenes, `dbplyr` and `dplyr`:

- translates R into SQL
- submits to database
- translates response from database into a R dataframe

Focus on `SELECT`.

## Check your understanding

Arrange the following steps in the correct order to find out the number of animals surveyed per year in the mammals database.

.pull-left[
```
1. Use `tbl` to create a reference to the `surveys` table.
2. `group_by` the year. 
3. Create a connection to the database.
4. `collect` the data.
5. `summarise` by counting the number of observations in each group.
```
]

Answer:

.pull-left[
```
3. Create a connection to the database.
1. Use `tbl` to create a reference to the `surveys` table.
2. `group_by` the year. 
5. `summarise` and count the number of observations in each group.
4. `collect` the data.
```
]

.pull-right[
```
mammals <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "data_raw/mammals.sqlite")

year_summary <- tbl(mammals, "surveys")
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(N = n()) %>%
  collect()
                
```
