- This will not form part of the 15 minute lesson presentation, but I have included them for reference.

## RStudio Cloud

For presentation of my lesson I will also make use of RStudio Cloud, to simulate what I would do in a workshop, giving participants access to what they need.

For the lesson, please:

1. Log in/sign up to RStudio Cloud beforehand by following this invitation link [here](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/46273/join?access_code=RV6EgpKyx7xDCNFKiUuESaxV48VvxUioUmoNOwtI).
2. Click on "Join space".
3. Click on "Projects" in the top menu bar.
4. Click on "Start" underneath "Databases in R".
5. This will open up the project as an assignment on RStudio Cloud. This is your version so don't be scared to play around!
