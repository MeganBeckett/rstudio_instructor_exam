## Why?

- Your data is already in a database.
- You have too much for your computer's memory to handle at once.
- Retrieve only what you need.
- All of your code is in R! :)

# 1. Connect to a database

## Connect to a database
### Many different databases

### Common databases have R packages

## Connect to a database

### Create the connection

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(dbplyr)

con <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), path = "data/my_database.sqlite")

```

--
</br>

A more realistic connection to a database on a server:

```{r eval = FALSE}
con <- DBI::dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), 
                      dbname = "my_database"
                      host = "database.lsdkjfslfj.uk-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
                      user = "student",
                      password = "my_password")
```

## Check your understanding

What is the most likely output from running the following piece of code and why?

</br>

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(dplyr)

con <- DBI:dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "data/mammals.sqlite")

data <- tbl(con, "species") 

nrow(data)
```

</br>

A. `NA` - as the `species` table is empty and therefore the `data` dataframe in R is empty.

B. `NA` - as `dplyr` is "lazy" and only pulls the data into R when explicitly asked.

C. `TRUE` - as we have created a successful connection to a database table.

D. `54` - as we have created a `data` dataframe in R from the `species` table in the database, which has 54 rows.

# 2. Query a database

---
## Query a database

### Using the dplyr syntax

Behind the scenes, `dbplyr` and `dplyr`:

- translates R into SQL
- submits to database
- translates response from database into a R dataframe

## Check your understanding

Arrange the steps in order to find out the number of animals surveyed per year in the mammals database.

</br>

.pull-left[

1: Use `tbl` to create a reference to the `surveys` table.

2: `group_by` the year. 

3: Create a connection to the database using `DBI`.

4: `collect` the data.

5: `summarise` by counting the number of observations in each group.
